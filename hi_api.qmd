## Reddit

- The "front page of the internet"

- Reddit has an API that allows developers to access and extract data from the platform.

:::
Reddit is a popular social news aggregation and discussion website where users can post content and interact with others.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Python to get data from Reddit using its API.

## What is an API?

 **A**pplication **P**rogram **I**nterface  

allows a user to programatically pull data from a source given that source provides one  
*ex. The NYT, Twitter, Facebook, Google, US Census*

## How Does it Work? 

- Think of it like this, just like a Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows you to interact with your code, an API lets your code interact with other code 
- Set of commands, functions, objects, and protocols
  - used to create software or interact with an external system (databases)
  - everywhere!
  - convenient - eady-made code to simplify the life of a programmer

## Not Only for Getting Data

- Build APIs for your ML models so others can use them
- Write (post) to a database
  - and update (put) and delete (delete)
- Functions
  - more control over what is exposed to end user

## So I Can Just Ask for Some Data, Like That?

No.  
Well, yes....kind of:
1. You must first agree to the terms of use and obtain and API Key.
   1. This authenticates you to the server that holds the data
   2. Sometimes it's simple and sometimes it's a process..be prepared 
2. Store this key in your .Renviron
   1. DO NOT SHARE/PUBLISH YOUR API KEY!! ☠️
3. Then, run your API call
   1. Data scientists mostly use "get" methods
   2. DO NOT SHARE/PUBLISH YOUR API KEY!! ☠️
4. Business as normal
   1. DO NOT SHARE/PUBLISH YOUR API KEY!! ☠️

1. Request API key ~ 24-48 hours
