*Abstract*: This talk is an introduction to using Python to get data from Reddit using its API. The talk covers the basics of Reddit API, how to obtain an API key, and the required libraries for accessing the API. The talk also provides examples of authenticating with the Reddit API, retrieving information about a subreddit, retrieving posts and comments from a subreddit, and submitting content. This talk is suitable for anyone with basic knowledge of Python programming who is interested in learning how to extract data from Reddit using its API

*About your speaker*:

Just a real, down-to-Mars girl, living in a material world, who took a midnight train going anywhere. Boring things: doctoral student at Drexel University in computational social sciences and NLP, Google WomenTechmakers ambassador, Social Justice in Data Science Bookclub Organizer, and #IamRemarkable Facilitator. Not so boring: cat-mom and wannabe wine connoisseur.
